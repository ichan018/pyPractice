Welcome to Ivan's directory.
This directory stores some user names and passwords.
An user can enter a username and password. The user can then change the password.

When you start the program, there will be 3 options:
-1 : Exit
0  : Login
1  : Add User

Typing -1 exits the program.

Typing 0 allows to login to a stored user.

Typing 1 allows you, the user who is operating this program, to add a new user to the program.

Note: At this time, the program cannot store user data after the program stops running. In other words, if you add user(s) and stop the program, all user datawill be erased. In the future, data can be stored for future re-runs of the program.
